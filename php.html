    <h1>PHP</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved 
            as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed 
            the first version of PHP way back in 1994.</li>
        <li>PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". <br>
            PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to 
            manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce 
            sites.</li>
